Overrides the remaining word when the cursor is in the middle and the completion is performed.
The original version replaces any word after:

> [Quoting taras1] It seems that if the cursor is in the middle of the word the completion does not
> override the whole word but its left part only.

> In the sample below I would expected the get_|errors to be replaced with get_saved_doc|. However
> the result is get_saved_doc|errors

But this one:

> I wrote a variation where it only replaces the remaining word, if it is a subword of the completed
> word. I added this because most times I am adding new words before the some word, and when I use
> the completion for this new word it was deleting my word.
