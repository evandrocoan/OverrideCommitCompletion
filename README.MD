# Sublime Text Overwrite Commit Completion


Overrides the remaining word when the cursor is in the middle and the completion is performed.


> [Quoting taras1] It seems that if the cursor is in the middle of the word the completion does not
> override the whole word but its left part only.

> In the sample below I would expected the get_|errors to be replaced with get_saved_doc|. However
> the result is get_saved_doc|errors
